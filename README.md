## Project Description 

This ReadMe Generator is a command line application that takes user input from a prompt, as well as the user's GitHub username to extract objects from an axios call to the GitHub API. All information retrieved will be written to a ReadMe.md file specifically for your repo.

The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```
